title: Linking your API key
---

In order to publish modules to the blockchain with our CLI, you must first generate an API key. See [Getting Started](https://nest.land/#start).

After you generate your API key, you need to add it in the CLI. To do this, type:

```shell script
eggs link <your key>
```

This will save your API key on your local machine. Now you will be able to publish modules to the blockchain without logging in ever again.

> Do **not** share your API key with anyone.
>
> If you want others to be able to publish a new version of your module, don't worry. We're working on a better solution!
